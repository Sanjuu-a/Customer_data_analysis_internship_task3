(a) Overview
Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to personalize marketing strategies, optimize customer retention, and maximize revenue. In this project, K-Means clustering is applied to a dataset containing customer shopping trends to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes.

(b) Clustering helps group customers with similar characteristics. This enables businesses to:
* Identify high-value customers for exclusive offers.
* Tailor marketing campaigns to different customer segments.
* Improve customer experience with personalized recommendations.

(c) Elbow Method & Silhouette Score for Optimal K:
* Elbow Method: Analyzes the within-cluster variance (inertia) to find the optimal K where adding more clusters does not significantly reduce error.
* Silhouette Score: Measures how well-defined the clusters are by computing the separation distance between clusters


By leveraging techniques like data preprocessing, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and optimal K selection using Elbow and Silhouette methods, we identified distinct customer groups. This segmentation model serves as a foundation for advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling, churn analysis, and targeted promotions, ensuring that businesses can make proactive, informed decisions in a competitive market.
